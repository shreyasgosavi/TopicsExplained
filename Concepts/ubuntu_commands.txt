		-mtime	<-- 	Files modified More (+) /Less (-)  than the specified days.
		-chmod	<-- 	Command to change the file permission for the type of users.
			
			Eg :  chmod u=rwx, g = rx, o = r <filename.extension>
				Where	u = Users,		r = Read 
					g = Group,		w = Write
					o = Others		x = Execute

				Other Forms of Permission can be given with the help of Octal Numbers :
				4 = Users 	3 = Groups 	1 = Others 	

				The advantage is that we can provide the permissions for all types of users with only 3 digits 
				
				Eg : 	chmod 777 <filename.extension>

					First digit refers to the type User.
					Second digit refers to the type Group.
					Third digit refers to the type Others.
