What is a shell?
Interprets user commands which are given directly by the user or can be read from shell-script.
Shell-scripts are interpreted.

Different types of shell :
	1. sh		: Bourne Shell
	2. bash		
	3. dash
	4. rbash


Bash file :

1st line : we specify the bash we are using. (Optional)

Comments #

Variables :	Used to store the data.
		There are two types of variables : 	1. System Variable  (All Caps)		
							2. User Defined Variable

		Variables are defined by normal name.
		Eg : 	name = SHR		<--- There should be no space in between 'name',
			'=' and 'SHR'.
		
		name=SHR	<-- Correct
		name = SHR	<-- Incorrect
		
		Variables are accessed by '$'.
		
		There are certain policies for variable name declaration.

		
Taking inputs :
	In bash we can take input with the help of the "read" command.	

	Eg :I	echo "Enter name:
		read name(name is a variable)
	
	    II	echo "Enter names"
		read n1 n2 n3
		echo "$n1 $n2 $n3"

	    III	read -p 	: "ENter the value" variable_name

	    IV	read -s		: For hiding the password.

	     V	read -a	varName	: Taking array inputs

		Fetching array value through indexes => ${arrayName[index]}
		
		echo "Values : ${varName[0]}, ${varName[1]}"

	    VI	By default the values are stored in REPLY system variable

Passing Arguments :
	
	We can pass the arguments while giving the commands in shell. By default the values are 
	stored in $1, $2, $3, $4.

	By default the list of arguments are stored in the array variable $@ .
		
	Eg. echo $@	


Conditional Statements:

	Sturcture of if-else statement :
	
		if [condition]
		then
			statement
		elif
		then
			statement
		else
			statement	
		fi
