Thymeleaf :
		It is a templating language that is used in java-web application. Templating
	language usually consists of expressions that is used along with templates of
	HTML, JS, XML, etc.


	Templating Engine :
		They are used to render data as HTML or other format through a template.
	Used for visualising the data that comes from the server or database.Templates are
	written in some templating language which combines the html with some special 
	templating tags. They are also used to generate documents in other format.


		Once Spring see's Thymeleaf starter dependency in the class-path then it 
	configures the View-Resolver automatically, for example under the resources folder 
	of the spring-boot project static content like images, css, js files are places in
	the static folder and html contents are places in the templates folder.

		As mentioned above we create HTML file in the templares folder and css and 
	js in the static folder.
	
		In html file we add link so to the thyme-leaf so that we can use the thyme-
	eaf attributes.
